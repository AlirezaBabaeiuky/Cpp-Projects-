This repository includes some nice projects written in C++. 

The scope resolution operator :: in C++ is used to access identifiers (variables, functions, classes, etc.) that are defined in different scopes. It is particularly useful when there is a naming conflict, where the same identifier is used in multiple scopes.
In C++ programming language, identifiers are the unique names assigned to variables, functions, classes, structs, or other entities within the program. Everything named by the programmer is identifier (function, class, struct, ...). Variable is the name given to a memory location. Token is the smallest entity in program that has a meaning. In programming languages, = is assignment operator and == is equality. A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address. The ampersand (&) is the "address-of" operator, used to get the memory address of a variable. The asterisk (*) is the "dereference" operator, used to access the value stored at the address a pointer holds. 
Asterisk (*)
Multiplication: Performs mathematical multiplication, as in int result = a * b;.
Pointer Declaration: Declares a variable as a pointer to a specific data type, as in int* p;.
Dereference Operator: Accesses the value stored at the memory address that a pointer holds, as in int value = *p;. 
Ampersand (&)
Address-of Operator: Returns the memory address of a variable, as in p = &a;.
Bitwise AND: Performs a bitwise AND operation on two integer values, as in int result = a & b;.
C++ Reference: Creates a reference (an alias) for an existing variable, as in int& r = a;
Logical AND, &&, Returns true only if all the operands are true or non-zero. e.g., cout << "a && b is " << (a && b) << endl; ---- answer is 1
Logical OR, ||, Returns true if either of the operands is true or non-zero
Logical NOT, !, Returns true if the operand is false or zero
Ternery or conditional operators - this is specific case that you can do instead of if. Syntax: Expression1 ? Expression2 : Expression3. If Expression1 is true, then Expression2 gets evaluated. If Expression1 is false, then Expression3 gets evaluated.
Arrow operator is used to access the variables of classes or structures through its pointer. sptr -> pointer; 
>> is extraction operator and << is insertion operator.
>> The continue statement is used to skip the loop body for the current iteration and continue from the next iteration. Unlike the break statement which terminates the loop completely, continue allows us just to skip one iteration and continue with the next iteration.
