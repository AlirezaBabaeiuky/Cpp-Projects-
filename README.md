# Cpp-Projects-
This repository includes some nice projects written in C++. 

The scope resolution operator :: in C++ is used to access identifiers (variables, functions, classes, etc.) that are defined in different scopes. It is particularly useful when there is a naming conflict, where the same identifier is used in multiple scopes.
In C++ programming language, identifiers are the unique names assigned to variables, functions, classes, structs, or other entities within the program. Everything named by the programmer is identifier. Variable is the name given to a memory location. Token is the smallest entity in program that has a meaning.
